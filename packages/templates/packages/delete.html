        <h2>Delete {{ package.name }}?</h2>

        <p>
            Are you absolutely sure you want to delete this package? Anyone
            who relies on it for development will be unable to access it on
            TwinePM ever again with the same name. Neither you nor anyone else
            will be able to create another package by the same name.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note also that, while this action will remove the package from the
            registry and prevent users from discovering it, the existing
            versions will continue to exist, so as to ensure that those
            currently using any versions can reinstall without issue.
        </p>
